      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I'm a self-teaching web developer and horticulturalist who loves <em>rare fruit</em>, <em>good aesthetics</em>, and <em>just sitting here, like this</em>. I work part-time as a self-employed exotic produce farmer and a full-time as a web code apprentice.</p>
      <p>I am fascinated by what has been acheived through online collaboration and the open-source movement. It ought to be an inspiration, a model even, for all aspects of society.</p>
      <p><em>And</em> I believe that techies should get their hands dirty and grow some food, too!</p>

      <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
      <p>I'm from California. Coastal California, specifically. I'm originally from Santa Barbara, and I've lived in Santa Cruz and San Francisco, Oakland and Pescadero. I love the fog. Like any true coastal Californian, I can't tolerate temperatures outside of a narrow 66&deg-79&degF range.
        
      I've settled in Oceano, California, in order to be near sixteen acres of family land on the ancient sand dune people around here call the Mesa. I'm harvesting and peddling goldenberries, a little jacketed superfruit, right now. </p>

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
      <p>I'm part of the farm-to-table cocktail movement (okay, and food too!). From time to time, I read a good book, usually involving history and war. Soccer rules. Also: world-traveling, particularly by bicycle-touring, if at all possible. My most important hobby (and skill, really), however, is lounging by a pool, near a beach, receiving one cocktail after another.</p>
      <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
      <p>Coding the full stack half of the time, growing uncommon fruit with the other half.</p>
      <h3>What's your background?</h3>
      <p>In high school (1999-ish), I hand-coded and hand-updated an "E/N" site (what people used to call blogs; stood for "Everything/Nothing"). I also taught myself basic C++ and enjoyed it. Wanted to major in computer science. Long story short, I spent some time traveling, rebelled against my teen nerd past and rejected computers. I majored in Community Studies, taught English in Chile, worked as a gardener, did the Peace Corps in a rural jungle village in the Dominican Republic. While there, totally disconnected from cell phones and electricity, let alone internet, a strange yearning to develop websites came upon me.</p>
      <h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
      <p>Bachata - it brings back memories of my shack in the jungle in the Dominican Republic. When I really want to focus I listen to Gold Panda, Crystal Castles, Bonobo, Ratatat. To relax: Emancipator, M&uacute;m. </p>
