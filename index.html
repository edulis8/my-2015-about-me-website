  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>I'm a horticulturalist and budding web developer who loves <em>rare fruit</em>, <em>fashion</em>, and <em>just sitting here, like this</em>. I work as a self-employed dirt farmer and an unemployed geek.</p> 
  <p>I am fascinated by what has been acheived through online collaboration and the open-source movement. It ought to be an inspiration, a model even, for all aspects of society.</p>
  <p><em>And</em> I firmly believe techies need to get their hands dirty and grow some food, too!</p>

  <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
  <p>I'm from California. Coastal California, specifically. I'm originally from Santa Barbara, and I've lived in Santa Cruz and San Francisco, Oakland and Pescadero. I love the fog. Like any true coastal Californian, I can't tolerate temperatures outside of a narrow 66&deg-79&degF range.
  
  I've settled in Oceano, California to grow and farm on 16 acres of family land on an ancient sand dune. I'm harvesting (and marketing!) goldenberries, right now. </p>

  <h2>More About Me</h2>
  <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
  <p>I'm part of the farm-to-table cocktail movement (well, and food too). From time to time, I read a good book, usually involving history and war. I might describe my politics as left-libertarian. Soccer rules. Also: world-traveling, particularly by bicycle-touring, if at all possible. My most important hobby (and skill, really), however, is lounging by a pool, near a beach, receiving one cocktail after another.</p>
  <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
    <p>Code half the time, farm half the time.</p>
  <h3>What's your background?</h3>
    <p>In high school (1999-ish), I hand-coded and hand-updated an "E/N" site (what people used to call blogs; stood for "Everything/Nothing"). I also taught myself basic C++ and enjoyed it. Wanted to major in computer science. Long story short, I spent some time traveling, rebelled against my teen nerd past and rejected computers. I majored in Community Studies, taught English in Chile, worked as a gardener, did the Peace Corps in a rural jungle village in the Dominican Republic. While there, totally disconnected from cell phones and electricity, let alone internet, a strange yearning to develop websites came upon me.</p>
  <h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
  <p>Bachata - it brings back memories of my shack in the jungle in the Dominican Republic. When I really want to focus I listen to Gold Panda or Crystal Castles. To relax: Emancipator, M&uacute;m. </p>
